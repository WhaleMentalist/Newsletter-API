# Newsletter-API
Showcase use of API to Mailchimp. Hosted the NodeJS instance in a Heroku environment. This was an extremely interesting and fun project to dive into.

Well, I learned a lesson today! Be careful what files you commit and pay attention to the remote you are pushing to. I managed to push API keys onto Github when I intended to add them to a production branch on a Heroku instance. Won't make that mistake twice!
